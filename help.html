                <p>The memory game is a common children's game played with a set of cards. The cards have a pictures on
                    one side and each picture appears on two (or sometimes four) cards. The game starts with all the
                    cards face down and players take turns to turn over two cards. If the two cards have the same
                    picture, then they keep the cards, otherwise they turn the cards face down again. To win you have to
                    find all matches.</p>

        <h3>The rules</h3>
        <p>For the purposes of this article, I'm going to consider a one-player version of the game:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The deck consists of <b>n</b> different card types (either <b>n</b> pairs of cards or <b>n</b> sets of 4
                cards).</li>
            <li>Each turn, you flip over two cards (one at a time, so you can see the first one before picking the
                second)</li>
            <li>If the two cards match, then they are removed from the game, otherwise they are returned</li>
            <li>The game ends when all the matches are founded</li>
        </ul>
